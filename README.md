# GOLANG WEB SERVER

This simple project shows you how to develop a web server to run HTML files on your local browser. Basically, the "Go Live" function of VSCode.

To test it and use it, after cloning the repo just run main.go, and accessing https://localhost:8080/hello or https://localhost:8080/form you will see the content of the html files inside the static/ folder. Change those to alter the website.
